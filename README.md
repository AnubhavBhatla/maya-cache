# maya-cache

This repository contains the artifact for evaluating the results of the Maya Cache paper from ISCA'24. Follow the steps below to generate the results from the paper:

------------------

## Obtain the code

`$ git clone https://github.com/casper-iitb/maya-cache`

------------------

## Requirements

To install all python related requirements, run

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

------------------

## Performance evaluation

#### Enter the performance-analysis directory

`$ cd maya-cache/performance-analysis`

#### Data dependencies

The zip file for the required GAP traces can be downloaded from https://utexas.app.box.com/s/2k54kp8zvrqdfaa8cdhfquvcxwh7yn85/folder/132804598561. Download it to the traces directory. 

To download the required SPEC CPU2017 traces, run the command: 

`$ ./traces.sh`

This also validates if the GAP benchmarks have been extracted in the correct directory.

In case `unzip` is not installed, please install it using `sudo apt install unzip`.

### Generate the required binaries

Run the following command to generate all the requied binaries:

`$ ./compile.sh`

### Run the performance simulations

`$ ./run.sh`

This step will take significant amount of time to complete (5-6 days).

### Generate the performance plots

Once all the performance simulations have been completed, the plots can be generated using

`$ ./plot.sh 0`

We have also provided our simulation results which can be used to generate the plots using:

`$ ./plot.sh 1`

---------------

## Security evaluation

### Enter the security-analysis directory

`$ cd ../security-analysis`


### Generate the required binaries

`$ make`

### Run the security simulations

`$ ./run.sh`

### Generate the security plots

Once all the security simulations have been completed, the plots can be generated using

`$ python3 plot.py`

----------------

## Expected Results

In the performance-analysis directory, two graphs are generated, namely, `fig1.pdf`, `fig10.pdf`. 

In the security-analysis directory, two graphs are generated, namely, `fig7.pdf`, `fig8.pdf`.
